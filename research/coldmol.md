Cold and ultracold molecules have many potential applications. Three "grand challenges" that have been laid down for the field are quantum simulation, precision measurements and controlled chemistry.

Sympathetic cooling, in which molecules are cooled by contact with ultracold atoms, will be crucial in producing the low temperatures and high densities required to meet these challenges. To achieve it, it is essential to understand and control molecular collisions. The molecules are invariably held in traps formed with electric, magnetic or optical fields. Inelastic or reactive collisions cause trap loss, and must be prevented when loading optical lattices for applications such as quantum simulation. Collisions also cause uncertainties in precision measurements.

Understanding collisions between ultracold atoms has been essential to the whole field of ultracold atom physics. It will be even more important for ultracold molecules, where there are many more possible outcomes and much more scope for control by external fields and/or state selection. This is the domain of cold and ultracold chemistry.

At low temperatures, collisions occur over a small range of energies and a small number of angular-momentum states. As the temperature approaches zero, we can limit them to a single hyperfine state and a single partial wave. In the mK regime, collision energies become comparable to energy-level shifts caused by externally applied electromagnetic fields. The collision dynamics are very sensitive to reactant quantum state, even at the hyperfine level, and applied electromagnetic fields can lead to dramatic changes in reaction rates and branching ratios.

Our vision is to understand the dynamics of cold molecular collisions and build a toolkit to control their outcome. To control molecular collisions effectively, we need fine control over the internal state and translational motion of the reactants.

We will use magnetic fields and quantum-state selection at the hyperfine level, as well as state-of-the-art theory, to understand fundamental collision processes and mechanisms of control. We will apply this understanding to control whether collisions lead to reaction or to inelastic energy transfer. By suppressing reactive and inelastic collisions, we aim to achieve sympathetic cooling.

The new and improved understanding achieved through this project can be used to control collisions in more complex systems. Species of interest include triatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules with large hydrocarbon side-chains. With further developments in experiment and theory, the complexity can grow until the toolbox of control protocols is full.

	            Bright solitons in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are a strong candidate for high precision matter-wave interferometry, as their inherent stability against dispersion supports long interrogation times. One analog to a beam splitter for these solitons is a narrow potential barrier. A very narrow barrier is desirable for interferometric purposes, but the width in a typical realisation, using a blue-detuned optical dipole potential, is limited by the wavelength of the laser light. We investigate a soliton interferometry scheme using the geometric scalar potential experienced by atoms in a spatially dependent dark state to overcome this limit. We propose a possible implementation and numerically probe the effects of deviations from the ideal configuration.</td>

	            Atomtronics deals with matter-wave circuits of ultra-cold atoms manipulated through magnetic or laser-generated guides with different shapes and intensities. In this way, new types of quantum networks can be constructed, in which coherent fluids are controlled with the know-how developed in the atomic and molecular physics community. In particular, quantum devices with enhanced precision, control and flexibility of their operating conditions can be accessed. Concomitantly, new quantum simulators and emulators harnessing on the coherent current flows can also be developed. Here, we survey the landscape of atomtronics-enabled quantum technology and draw a roadmap for the field in the near future. We review some of the latest progresses achieved in matter-wave circuits design and atom-chips. Atomtronic networks are deployed as promising platforms for probing many-body physics with a new angle and a new twist. The latter can be done both at the level of equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. Numerous relevant problems in mesoscopic physics, like persistent currents and quantum transport in circuits of fermionic or bosonic atoms, are studied through a new lens. We summarize some of the atomtronics quantum devices and sensors. Finally, we discuss alkali-earth and Rydberg atoms as potential platforms for the realization of atomtronic circuits with special features.</td>

	            We investigate the collective scattering of coherent light from a thermal alkali-metal vapor with temperatures ranging from 350 to 450 K, corresponding to average atomic spacings between 0.7λ and 0.1λ. We develop a theoretical model treating the atomic ensemble as coherent, interacting, radiating dipoles. We show that the two-time second-order correlation function of a thermal ensemble can be described by an average of randomly positioned atomic pairs. Our model illustrates good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, we show how fine-tuning of the experimental parameters may make it possible to explore several photon statistics regimes.</td>
