Part of our role as researchers is to carry out public outreach activities to share our knowledge and passion for science. We want to help wider audiences understand what it is we do, what impacts this can have on everyday life and, most of all, inspire young people to get involved in science.

We are involved in, and organise many events throughout the year.

[World of atoms](https://www.worldofatoms.com/)   is a workshop to introduce 8 to 10 year old children to the beauty of atoms and their intricate interactions with light - brought to life with discussion, art, experiment, poetry and dance. Feedback from children includes: <br> 
_I enjoyed writing about the elements and atoms, I enjoyed it all. <br> 
I liked learning about the periodic table._ <br>
