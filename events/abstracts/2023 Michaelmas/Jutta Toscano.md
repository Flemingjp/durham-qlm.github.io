## Manoeuvring chemical reactions one degree of freedom at a time

The combined use of electric fields, magnetic fields and laser light affords us an ever-increasing level of control over the properties of atoms and molecules, enabling reactivity to be probed as a function of their
various degrees of freedom [1]. Here, we discuss how electrostatic deflection [2] can be employed to disentangle the reactivity of molecules in different rotational states, or with different spatial orientation of their
constituent atoms [3]. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the sympathetic cooling of different conformational isomers within a Coulomb crystal [4], setting the scene for fully conformationally selected ionâ€“molecule reaction studies.
