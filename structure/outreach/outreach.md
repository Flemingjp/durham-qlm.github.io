Part of our role as researchers is to carry out public outreach activities to share our knowledge and passion for science. We want to help wider audiences understand what it is we do, what impacts this can have on everyday life and, most of all, encourage young people to get involved in science.

Supporting material to our outreach events can be found in the following links.
