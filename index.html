**THIS WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY BEING UPDATED** The Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) research section encompasses several research groups sharing a common interest in the study of the quantum properties of atoms, molecules and solids and their interactions with light. Our work aims to advance our fundamental understanding of quantum light and matter, whilst exploring a broad range of applications in quantum science, metrology and quantum technologies.
