title: Join QLM
subtitle: Opportunities to join as graduate students
---
When you join Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) as a PhD or Master by research student, youâ€™ll become a member of a friendly research section home to almost 50 members, 
including permanent staff, research fellows, research associates and PhD students. <br>

Each graduate cohort receives training in skills required to excel in the program. This includes lecture courses in atom-light interactions and advanced data analysis, 
and experimental skills workshops on CAD design and optics. Students and postdoctoral researchers are all given a desk in the shared office enabling easy sharing of ideas and problem solving. <br>

Each week begins with our group meeting, when each team member is given the opportunity to share updates from their project. During term time we host weekly seminars from 
external speakers. These is also the opportunity to travel and attend international conferences and meet researchers from around the world. These are just some of the 
opportunities and benefits available to members of the group. <br>

We have a selection of funded PhD projects available, and further opportunities which are likely to receive funding for an October 2024 start. We hope that you will join us
and become a part of the QLM!<br>
