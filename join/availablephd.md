 _Current PhD students in the QLM_<br>
  {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}
When you join Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) as a PhD or Master by research student, you’ll become a member of a friendly research section home to almost 50 members, 
including permanent staff, research fellows, research associates and PhD students. <br>

Each graduate cohort receives training in skills required to excel in the program. This includes lecture courses in atom-light interactions and advanced data analysis, 
and experimental skills workshops on CAD design and optics. Students and postdoctoral researchers are all given a desk in the shared office enabling easy sharing of ideas and problem solving. <br>

Each week begins with our group meeting, when each team member is given the opportunity to share updates from their project. During term time we host weekly seminars from 
external speakers. These is also the opportunity to travel and attend international conferences and meet researchers from around the world. These are just some of the 
opportunities and benefits available to members of the group. <br>

We have a selection of funded PhD projects available, and further opportunities which are likely to receive funding for an October 2024 start. We hope that you will join us
and become a part of the QLM!<br>

      	**High Speed Terahertz Imaging using Rydberg Atoms.**<br>
The terahertz (THz) frequency band lies between the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because THz radiation is non-ionising and passes through materials such as paper, cloth, and   plastics, it finds applications including security screening, biomedical imaging, and production-line monitoring. The THz region has traditionally been a difficult frequency range to work in because it falls between ranges of electronic and photonic devices - This is known as the ‘terahertz gap’ and although significant progress has been made to close this gap, applications are still limited by the low power output of THz sources and the low speed and sensitivity of THz detectors. In Durham, we have recently developed a new technology for terahertz imaging that uses Rydberg atoms to convert terahertz radiation to optical fluorescence. This has allowed unprecedented speed and sensitivity in image acquisition. This experimental Ph.D. project will push our technology to the next level by using laser pulse sequences to allow very short exposure images. This will allow very fast phenomena, such as shockwaves, to be studied in optically opaque media. The work is linked to the National Quantum Technology Hub programme and Industrial partners.<br>

      	**Simulating quantum magnetism and synthetic dimensions using ultracold molecules in magic traps.**<br>
The rich rotational structure of molecules offers an unrivalled playground for the encoding of spins and synthetic dimensions which can be precisely controlled using microwave fields. We have recently demonstrated record-breaking rotational coherences in a novel magic-wavelength trap. In this project you will exploit this capability to study models of quantum magnetism with spins encoded in the rotational states of RbCs molecules and interactions controlled through the combination of states and applied fields.<br>

            **Dipolar quantum gas of atoms**<br>
            Ultracold gases of atoms and molecules are an important resource for the precise experimental study of quantum mechanics. In these experiments, dipole-dipole interactions can be used to engineer long-range and tunable interactions between particles, thereby enabling the study of complex many-body phenomena. In this project, we will develop a new apparatus for the study of dipolar quantum gases. This will include an exploration of laser cooling and optical trapping of atoms, and the study of collisions and interactions in atomic mixtures.<br>
            This is a new experimental project, for further information contact <a href="mailto:p.d.gregory@durham.ac.uk">Dr. Gregory</a>.
